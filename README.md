# StockProject

Created: ~ May 3rd, 2023 while attending Modesto Junior College.

Purpose: This project returns the unit price of a stock upon request among other information.

Password: Get your own password at "https://www.alphavantage.co/". The password is an active API Key. There are free API Keys available at that address.

Old residencies: Project originally created on Replit with some guidance from CoPilot when it came to learning BeautifulSoup. 

Notes: Utilized BeautifulSoup module and Alpha Vantage Stock API (Get Free API's Here: "https://www.alphavantage.co/" ). Only aspect that works now compared to before is the data pulled from Alpha Vantages' API due to Google implementing a new type of encryption on their webpages involving JS diverting machine "users" (bots) to error pages instead of willingly providing entire pages of HTML content upon probing. Suggestions from online suggest changing to Selenium drivers to avoid the downsides of Googles' new implementation/tactic.  

What I Would Change/Add Now:
    -OOP for each stock named
    -possibility for portfolio & user profile to be created (both OOP additions)
    -interface file for main's contents
    -better execution of math as seen in "OrganizedVer" (which despite its' name is far from it according to my standards)
    -Experimental: (If Possible) Possibility to have user request further mathematical methods in modules being utilized, and as a result of request, utilizing OS module to create personalized programs for user to digest along with their dataset
    - session report
